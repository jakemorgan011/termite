# termite
open source alternative live-coding language

# proof of concept.
currently "compiles" to check is "sin" is inside the string and plays a test tone if true;

# current fixings:
- creating termite namespace with custom data types to avoid having to use juce framework for anything non-audio.
- STRING PARSING --- current research. Figuring it out rn.
- Sample loading and unloading.
- simple oscillator design for easy creation inside the code.

# long term fixes:
create hash map to store all variables in the termite "terminal"
